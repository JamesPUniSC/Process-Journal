## Initial Ideas
Simple initial ideas that could be expanded upon for the project:

- **Heart Shirt:** A Shirt with LEDs in a heart shape that flashes with the beating of the wearers heart.
- **Auto Lamp:** A lamp that gets brighter as the enviroment gets darker
- **Needy Robot:** A little robot that follows people and avoids obsatcles.
- **Med-Boy:** A device on the wrist/forearm that has a bunch of biometrics to monitor wearers health.
- **Shock Roulett:** More of a game, a small device that people will take turns holding that will randomly make a loud noise or small shock made more likely by how nervous the user is.

## Genral Idea

### Initial Description
Three handles connected to a main unit that holds a microbit processor. Each of the handles will have sensors to detect pluse and how sweaty the hands of the person holding the handle is and a vibration motor or some way to shock the holder. When a button on the device is pressed a "weight" is assinged to each handle based on how nervous the user by detecting their pulse and sweat of their palm. the device will then pick a handle at random, being more likely to pick a handle with a higher weight, to shock.

### Activation / Use
I have three ideas for how the device can be activated / will be used:

1. Each handles has an individual button and the users will press the buttons individually when indicated to do so by LEDs on the main unit. When the button is pressed the device will alocate a chance of being shocked ranging from somewhere between 40% - 90% based on how nervous the device thinks the user is.

2. Theres one button on the main unit and when the button is pressed there will be a countdown and near the end of the countdown each handles weight will be computed and the device will choose a handle to shock at random, weighted towards those that were detected to be more nervous.

3. A lose combination of the above methods, one handle connected to the main unit either by cables or being fully connected into the main unit. When the button on the handle is pressed some kind of countdown (i.e. A speaker counting down, A speaker playing a short tune, LEDs turning off) near the end of the count down a weight will be assigned based off how nervous the device thinks the user is. The device is then more likely to shock the user based on nerves in a similar range to the first idea.

Right now the best option

The main unit of the device will

### Weight Distribution


### Method of Shocking


### Additional Thoughts
A list of thoughts I had during the development of this idea that might be implemented:
- A reverse pity system where the device makes you more likley to be shocked based on how many times you haven't been.
- A way to switch between the two modes mentioned in the Activation / Use section.
